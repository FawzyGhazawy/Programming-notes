     /* 
path: 'products/:productId': This part specifies the URL path for this route.
 In this case, it defines a route with the path 'products/:productId'.
  The :productId portion is a route parameter, indicated by the colon (:) prefix.
   It signifies that this part of the URL can vary and will be treated as
    a parameter named productId. For example, if the URL is /products/123, 
    then 123 would be passed as the value for productId.

component: ProductDetailsComponent: 
This part specifies the component that should be rendered when navigating to the
 defined URL path. In this case, it specifies that when the URL matches the pattern
  'products/:productId', Angular should render the ProductDetailsComponent.
     */

    /*this.route.snapshot.paramMap: Accesses the current route's parameter map.
routeParams.get('productId'): Retrieves the value of the route parameter named 'productId'.
Number(...): Converts the retrieved parameter value to a number. 
This assumes that the product IDs are represented as numbers.

.snapshot is a property that allows you to access the current state of 
the activated route at the moment the component is initialized.

 paramMap is a property that provides a map of the route parameters for the current route. 
 It represents the parameters extracted from the route URL as key-value pairs.

 routeParams.get('productId'): Retrieves the value of the 
 route parameter named 'productId' from the paramMap.

The decision to use square brackets ([]) around routerLink depends
 on whether you want to provide a static or dynamic value.

Static Value (Without square brackets):

When the value of routerLink is known and doesn't need to be dynamically evaluated 
at runtime, you can use it without square brackets.
For example, if you have a fixed route like routerLink="/cart", where the path is constant 
and doesn't change, you can use it without square brackets.
<a routerLink="/cart">Go to Cart</a>

Dynamic Value (With square brackets):

When the value of routerLink needs to be dynamically determined at runtime, you should use square brackets.
For example, if you want to construct the route based on some dynamic data or input, such as 
a product ID, you should use square brackets to bind to a property or 
expression that resolves to the desired route value.

<a [routerLink]="['/products', productId]">View Product</a>
In summary:

Use routerLink="/static-route" when the route is static and known in advance.
Use [routerLink]="[dynamicValue]" when the route needs to be 
dynamically constructed based on runtime data or variables.
